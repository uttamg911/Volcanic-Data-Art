Run the do_volcano_4.pde ( do => digital organic , volcano => visualization name, 4 => version number )
It automaticallly runs its dependencies, Particle.pde & ParticleSystem.pde 
Just speak into the microphone and see the volcano shudder and gush lava particles. 

The visualization is built using Daniel Shiffman's Simple Particle System and minimAudio library.

Philosophy behind the visualization: 
Every word that we speak is like a blob of volcano which has a potential to hurt others.
On the other hand, they can also be percieved as with full of life and inspire people. 
( The life like nature is viewed as a pulsation). Since, the words we speak are often forgotten,
the particles fade away with time.
