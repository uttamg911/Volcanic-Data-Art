Run the do_volcano_4.pde ( do => digital organic , volcano => visualization name, 4 => version number )
It automaticallly runs its dependencies, Particle.pde & ParticleSystem.pde 

The visualization is built upon the Daniel Shiffman's Simple Particle System and minimAudio library.
Just speak into the microphone and see the volcano shudder and gush lava particles. 

Philosophy behind the visualization: 
Every word that we speak is like a blob of volcano which has a potential to hurt others.
On the other hand, they can also be percieved as with full of life and inspire people. 
( The life like nature is viewed as a pulsation). Since, the words we speak are often forgotten,
the particles fade away with time.
